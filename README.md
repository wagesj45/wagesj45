# Jordan Wages Github
Hi! Iâ€™m a computer engineer from Rochester, MN. I like pith. I also like the Internet. C# 'til I die, baby.

## Trophies
I saw these on someone's profile and thought they were neat so here are mine.

## Projects
I'm a big fan of open source software and I've got a few projects here that you might find useful.

* [Gray Duck Mail](https://github.com/wagesj45/gray-duck-mail)
  - Gray Duck Mail is an alternative to email discussion group software such as Mailman and Sympa designed to be easy to set up and easy to manage. Gray Duck Mail monitors a remote mail server for messages and processes them by relaying the message to all list members. Gray Duck Mail also automatically handles user subscriptions, unsubscription requests, and email bounces. Gray Duck Mail works with any external email host that allows for POP3/SMTP connections and message forwarding or aliasing. Gray Duck Mail relies totally on an external mail provider, allowing you to use an existing web host or email account.
* [CS-MIC](https://github.com/wagesj45/cs-mic)
  - CS-MIC is a .NET library written in C# designed to give developers easy access to expression parsing. For many developers, there is no need to involve complicated settings and formats. With few exposed methods and objects, CS-MIC makes basic expression solving as simple as possible with as little logic required from developers as possible. In fact, one can pull a value with only one line of code.
  - This is an older project, but still useful if you need to parse mathmatical formulas in your .NET projects. This project is basically in hibernation because it works and unless someone reports an issue or enhancement.
* [butterflow-ui](https://github.com/wagesj45/butterflow-ui)
  - butterflow-ui is a graphical front end for interacting with the butterflow command line application in Windows.
* [MimeTypeList](https://github.com/wagesj45/MimeTypeList)
  - Provides a hard-coded collection of file extension and mime type mapping. This project was inspired by samuelneff/MimeTypeMap. This project uses the data from that project to create classes with members for each extension and mime type for lookups.
